Unit tests for Player model - T068

TDD Red Phase: These tests define the behavior and constraints for the Player model.
All tests should fail initially until the Player model is implemented.

Coverage:
- Player model fields and validation
- Profile information and stats
- Sport-specific player data
- Team/Club associations
- Performance tracking
- Model relationships
