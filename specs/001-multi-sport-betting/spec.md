# Feature Specification: Multi-Sport Betting Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-multi-sport-betting`  
**Created**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Multi-Sport Betting Platform - Create a comprehensive responsive web application supporting multiple sports (soccer, handball, extensible to others) and competition types: international championships (World Cup, European Championships), domestic leagues (Bundesliga, Premier League, La Liga), and tournament formats (knockout vs round-robin). Core Features: Users register with email/password/display name, authenticate via Keycloak IAM with OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect plus social login (Google, Facebook, Apple). Group management includes private groups (invitation codes) and public groups (admin approval required) with advanced admin capabilities: invite/remove users, edit settings, delegate admin rights, set custom betting deadlines per competition, customize scoring rules. Member limits with paid extension opportunities for monetization. Betting System: Users predict both winner and exact final score earning 1 point for correct winner, 3 points total (1+2 bonus) for exact score. NO default bets - users must actively place bets to participate. Configurable betting deadlines (default 1 hour before match, admin customizable) with refined policy: deadline changes prohibited for next upcoming match or simultaneous matches, only modifiable for future matches, becoming permanently fixed once match becomes next. Match Management: Manual result entry initially with architecture supporting future sports API integration. Provisional results system for immediate engagement with final results within 24-48 hours including user notifications for changes. Live ranking updates during matches. Match rescheduling notifications for all participants with updated deadlines. Data Architecture: Store teams, players, lineups, competitions (tournaments vs leagues), seasons, and comprehensive betting data. Support season-based competitions with multiple matchdays/rounds. Database design for User, Group, Game, Bet, Result, Competition, Season, Team, Player, Sport entities. Edge Cases Resolved: 1) Betting after deadline shows disabled UI with clear messaging, 2) Delayed results use provisional+final system with notifications, 3) Group access issues handled with member limits and 72-hour invitation expiry showing Group not found for inaccessible groups, 4) Ranking ties resolved by sequence: total points ‚Üí exact score predictions ‚Üí correct winner predictions ‚Üí registration date, 5) Deadline changes use refined anti-gaming policy. Quality Systems: Fair tiebreaker sequences prioritizing skill, transparent audit trails for admin actions, group invitation security (72-hour expiry), concurrent betting conflict handling, permanent data persistence, secure session management, responsive mobile-first design. Technical Foundation: Multi-competition architecture supporting both knockout tournaments and round-robin leagues, real-time provisional rankings for engagement, API-ready for sports data integration, scalable design for new sports/competitions, comprehensive error handling and edge case management. Business Features: Group member limits with paid extensions, live engagement through provisional rankings, transparent fair play systems, no gaming opportunities, comprehensive admin controls, audit trails for accountability, monetization through premium group features."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A sports fan wants to compete with friends by predicting match outcomes across multiple sports and competitions. They create or join betting groups, place predictions on match winners and exact scores, and track their performance through live rankings during competitions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### User Registration & Authentication
1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they provide email, password, and display name, **Then** their account is created and they can authenticate
2. **Given** an existing user, **When** they login with social providers (Google, Facebook, Apple), **Then** they are authenticated via OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect
3. **Given** a user forgets their password, **When** they request reset, **Then** they receive secure reset instructions

#### Group Management
1. **Given** a user wants to create a private group, **When** they create it with invitation code, **Then** only users with the code can join
2. **Given** a user wants to create a public group, **When** they submit for creation, **Then** admin approval is required before activation
3. **Given** a group admin, **When** they invite users, **Then** invitations expire after 72 hours for security
4. **Given** a group reaches member limits, **When** admin wants more members, **Then** paid extension options are available

#### Betting System
1. **Given** an upcoming match, **When** user places bet before deadline, **Then** they predict winner and exact score
2. **Given** a correct winner prediction, **When** results are final, **Then** user earns 1 point
3. **Given** an exact score prediction, **When** results are final, **Then** user earns 3 points total (1 + 2 bonus)
4. **Given** betting deadline has passed, **When** user tries to bet, **Then** interface is disabled with clear messaging
5. **Given** no bet placed, **When** match concludes, **Then** user earns 0 points (no default bets)

#### Match & Results Management
1. **Given** a match concludes, **When** provisional results are entered, **Then** rankings update immediately for engagement
2. **Given** provisional results are available, **When** final results are confirmed within 24-48 hours, **Then** users are notified of any changes
3. **Given** a match is rescheduled, **When** new time is set, **Then** all participants are notified with updated betting deadlines

#### Ranking & Scoring
1. **Given** users have equal points, **When** tiebreaker is needed, **Then** sequence is: total points ‚Üí exact scores ‚Üí correct winners ‚Üí registration date
2. **Given** multiple matches in progress, **When** results come in, **Then** rankings update live during competitions
3. **Given** a competition season, **When** matches span multiple rounds, **Then** cumulative scoring tracks across all matchdays

### Edge Cases

#### Deadline Management
- What happens when admin tries to change deadline for next upcoming match? ‚Üí System prevents changes to maintain fairness
- What happens when multiple matches start simultaneously? ‚Üí Deadline changes prohibited for any simultaneous matches
- What happens when match becomes "next" in queue? ‚Üí Deadline becomes permanently fixed, no further changes allowed

#### Group Access & Security
- What happens when invitation code expires? ‚Üí User sees "Group not found" message for security
- What happens when group exceeds member limits? ‚Üí New joins blocked until admin purchases extension or removes members
- What happens when user tries accessing removed group? ‚Üí "Group not found" error maintains privacy

#### Betting Conflicts
- What happens when user places multiple bets on same match? ‚Üí Last valid bet before deadline overwrites previous bets
- What happens when provisional and final results differ? ‚Üí Users notified, points recalculated, audit trail maintained
- What happens when match is cancelled after bets placed? ‚Üí Bets voided, points not awarded, users notified

#### System Reliability
- What happens during high traffic betting periods? ‚Üí System maintains performance with proper conflict handling
- What happens when user loses internet during bet placement? ‚Üí Bet only counts if successfully submitted before deadline
- What happens to data when user deletes account? ‚Üí Permanent data persistence for competition integrity, anonymized historical data retained
