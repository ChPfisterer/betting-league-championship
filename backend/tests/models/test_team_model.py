Unit tests for Team model - T066

TDD Red Phase: These tests define the behavior and constraints for the Team model.
All tests should fail initially until the Team model is implemented.

Coverage:
- Team model fields and validation
- Team information and branding
- Player roster management
- Performance statistics
- League/competition participation
- Model relationships
