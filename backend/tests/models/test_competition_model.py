Unit tests for Competition model - T065

TDD Red Phase: These tests define the behavior and constraints for the Competition model.
All tests should fail initially until the Competition model is implemented.

Coverage:
- Competition model fields and validation
- Competition types and formats
- Season management
- Team/participant management
- Status workflow (upcoming, active, completed)
- Prize and point systems
- Model relationships
