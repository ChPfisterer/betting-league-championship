"""
Unit tests for GroupMembership model - T063

TDD Red Phase: These tests define the behavior and constraints for the GroupMembership model.
All tests should fail initially until the GroupMembership model is implemented.

Coverage:
- GroupMembership model fields and validation
- Member roles and permissions
- Join/leave timestamp tracking
- Status management (active, pending, banned)
- Composite unique constraints
- Model relationships
