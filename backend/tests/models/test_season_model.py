Unit tests for Season model - T066

TDD Red Phase: These tests define the behavior and constraints for the Season model.
All tests should fail initially until the Season model is implemented.

Coverage:
- Season model fields and validation
- Date range management and validation
- Status workflow (upcoming, active, completed)
- Competition association
- Season-specific settings and rules
- Model relationships
